## WEB422 code examples

Organized by week. Each "week" page has a README file that describes that week's code examples.

You can browse the code online.

You can also download the repository as a zip file.

Or, you can clone the repository to your own computer.

**NOTE** An updated set of Code examples has replaced the old "Code Examples" folder. The old "Code Examples" has been renamed to "Code Examples v1" and will be removed in future versions of this course.
