## Policies and Standards

### Contacting Faculty

It is up to the individual faculty member to inform you about their availability outside of class. Generally speaking, if you email your professor for help, you can expect a response within 2 business days.

If you need help debugging your code, please make an appointment with your professor during their office hours so that you can work through the solution together.

### Lectures & Student Conduct

* Be on time for class

* Respect other students

* Lectures will explain and demonstrate the skills and concepts you need to complete the assignments.

* Frequent absence will be noted. You are responsible on all tests and labs for any material covered or assigned in class. People who do not come to class generally have significant problems completing their assignments and traditionally do not perform well on their tests.

* Classes will start on time and late arrivals must not disturb the class. Enter quietly and take a seat. Do not disturb the class by asking questions about what took place before your arrival.

* If you missed a class, please ask a colleague, not the instructor, about what was covered. An email to an instructor about what was covered in class will get a response along the lines of “that was covered in class”.

* Please ensure that you follow <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/students/academic-honesty-policy">Seneca College Academic Honesty Policy</a> when you do your work. Violations of the Academic Honesty Policy will not be tolerated.

### Tests

We have planned six (6) tests during the term, each worth 10% of your final course grade.

The duration of each test will range from 30 to 35 minutes. Each test will be available on My.Seneca for 24 hours on the day discussed with your professor.

If you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. However, absence due to illness or other reasons happen occasionally. As a result, you can miss up to one (1) test, without suffering the loss of grades.

The effect of this policy will be extended to all students. At the end of the course, your lowest test result will be discarded, leaving your best five results for a total of 50% of your final grade.

### Assignments

We have planned six (6) assignments during the term.

Most assignments have a two-week lifetime. Most are independent of each other. If you do not submit an assignment by the due date, its grade is zero, and there is no opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.

Each assignment will be worth 9% of your final course grade, exept the first assignment which is worth 5%. The total value of all assignments will be 50%.

#### Submission Policy

* Assignments must be created as specified in the assignment specification
* Late Assignment submissions will not be accepted and will receive a **grade of zero (0)** if not complete by the due date
* Submitted assignments must run locally, ie: start up errors causing the assignment/app to fail on startup will result in a **grade of zero (0)** for the assignment.

**Important Note:** Posting your assignment solutions anywhere online (ie: stackoverflow, public gitHub repositories, etc.) constitutes a violation of Seneca College’s Academic Integrity Policy, ie:
“Obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain, credit for work or improvement in evaluation of performance, by dishonest or deceptive means.” ( [Seneca College Academic Integrity Policy – Cheating](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) )

<br />

### Summary

6 Tests - 50% (10%/ea)<br>
6 Assignments - 50% ([A1] = 5%, [A2-A6] = 9%/ea)  

<br>

### Promotion Policy

* Achieve an average of 50% or better for all assignments
*	Achieve an average of 50% or better for all tests
*	Achieve a weighted average of 50% or better for the course

<br>

**Make-up (replacement) tests? No.**

We don't do make-up or replacement tests, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* Tests are designed, in part, to encourage you to prepare for class before you walk into the room. Doing a test after the class has happened just doesn't make sense.

* Your lowest test result is discarded before your final grade is calculated, so missing a test does not affect your final grade.

* Test answers are discussed during class, so doing a test after class is pointless.

Therefore, no make-up or replacement tests. 

<br>

**Due date extensions? No.**

We don't do due date extensions for assignments, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* They cause problems for other work that follows an assignment, because it leaves less time to complete the next piece of work.

* They take your attention away from new topics in this course. You're less receptive, or will ignore, new topics that follow the ones that are practiced on the assignment.

* A due date extension is disrespectful to other students in the course, because it tells them that the work they did to meet the due date doesn't have value.

* Finally a due date extension is disrespectful to other professors and their courses, because it takes your attention away from their coursework while you are working on late work.

Therefore, no due date extensions.
