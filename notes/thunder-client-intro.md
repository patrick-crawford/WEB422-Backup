## Introduction to the Thunder Client Extension

Thunder Client is a Visual Studio Code extension that enables web programmers to interact with a web service (aka web API) without the need to install additional software. 

This kind of extension enables us to focus on web service creation - which is a server-focused development effort - without the additional burden of creating a separate client/requestor app that interacts with the web service. It *is* the client app as we test and interact with the web service. 

Its user interface gives us the ability to "compose" a request. Then, we can send the request. Finally, we can inspect the response. The extension saves a history of requests, making it easy to see that you're making progress.

### Start Up

After installing the extension, you can get started by clicking on the new "thunderbolt" icon in the left sidebar.  This should show you the following screen, with the option to create a new request.

### Important features

Once you click the "New Request" button, you will notice that the screen is populated with additional information. For beginners, there are two important features:
1. Request and response areas - enables you to inspect the contents of both the request and the response (right pane)
3. List of past requests - saves all requests as a history under the "Activity" tab (left pane)

### What is an HTTP request?

As you know, HTTP is a message-passing protocol, between two endpoints. One end will send a request, and the other will send a response. 

The requester can be a browser (which is what all students have experience with), or it can be a component in an app. For example, almost every smartphone app includes a component - generically known as an HTTP client - that enables it to communicate with a web service. 

HTTP defines several kinds of requests. At a minimum, a simple "get me some data" request must include the *HTTP method* (e.g. GET, POST, etc.), and a *URL*. Other kinds of requests must include other metadata. 

Remember, [RFC 7231]() is the authoritative resource for the HTTP protocol.

#### Compose a request - GET

To compose an HTTP GET request, two settings are required:
1. HTTP method, GET
2. URL of the collection or object

Other settings may be required (e.g. security-related info, etc.), and we'll see those in the future.

#### Compose a request - POST

A POST request is designed to enable the requestor to "add" a new item to the collection that is represented by the URL. Obviously, when compared to a GET request, more is required. 

To compose an HTTP POST request, four settings are required:
1. HTTP method, POST
2. URL of the collection
3. A header that defines the content type of the data we're sending
4. Data (the new item)

As above, other settings may be required, but these will enable you to get started. 

The image below shows a simple post request, with metadata for the first three settings. Notice that you must select the "Headers" tab to get to the data-entry panel. The header we want is `Content-Type`, and its value will be `application/json`, because that's what we're sending

The image below shows how to enter metadata for the fourth setting. Select the "Body" tab and then in the text entry area, add the JSON that correctly defines a new item for the collection.
