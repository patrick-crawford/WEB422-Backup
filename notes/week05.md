## WEB422 Week 5 Notes

Week 5 brings us to our final week discussing React, before we move on to Angular.  For this week, we will round out our discussion by focusing on how we can accept user input ([forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)) and how we can synchronize their values with the state of a component.  Next, we will look at how we can build and deploy a React application to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) using a simple Node.js server.

**Topics:**

* [Processing forms in React](react-forms)

* [Serving a React App / Hosting on Heroku](serving-react-heroku)
