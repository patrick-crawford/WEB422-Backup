## Angular Deployment Introduction

Until now, we've been working with our web applications in a local environment.  We have relied on the frameworks (the integrated "development servers" included in React and Angular) to execute our code on *localhost*.  However, sooner or later we will have to build and publish these applications so that they are available for the public to use. 

<br>

### Angular App Deployment with Netlify

Previously, we used Heroku for hosting our web applications, but there are a lot of other options available. Heroku works well when you have a backend for your application. However, if you just have a front-end application, there are other services that are more convenient to use. One of them is Netlify, and we are going to use it for deploying our Angular applications.

<br>

#### Preparation

Before we actually go and deploy our app with Netlify, there are a few steps that need to be done first:

#### _redirects file

Netlify will need to know what to do with routes that are manually entered by the user in the navigation bar.  This problem was previously solved by redirecting back to index.html on 404 errors in our server.js file when using Node.js to host our apps.  However, since we're hosting our App on Netlify, we need to add a special file: "_redirects" to configure this setting:

* Open your angular.json file and locate the "assets" array under the "architect" property

* Add the value: `"src/_redirects"` 

* In the src folder add a _redirects file that contains the following line: `/* /index.html 200`

<br>

### GitHub

Once again, we will need to host the source code of the application online and GitHub is the perfect place to do this.  Proceed to create a new repository for your code.  If you need a quick refresher on how this is done, please refer to the "GitHub" section in the notes on [Serving a React Application with Vercel](/serving-react-vercel).

<br>

### Deployment

Once we have made our source code available on GitHub, we can proceed to [Netlify's website](https://www.netlify.com/) and deploy our app.

You will need a Netlify account, so click "Sign Up" on the navigation bar. You will have several sign-up options there - since you have a GitHub account, go ahead and login with GitHub. 

Once you have logged in, you should see the "Sites" page. Proceed to create a "New site from Git".

Select GitHub from the "Continuous Deployment" section.

It will prompt you to select a repository, so simply click on the name of the repository containing your project. 

Next, you will have to fill in the deploy settings for your app:
  
1. Make sure that the "master" branch is selected under "Branch to deploy" option.
2. Add a build command stating (this should be the default): `npm run build`.
3. Add the publish directory: `dist/NAME_OF_YOUR_APP`.

4. Click "Deploy site".
    
    This will take you to the site overview page, where you can find all the details about your project. Currently, you will see that the site is being published. After some time, if the site is built successfully, you will see the URL to your published website.

    **Congrats**, your app is live!

### Updating Your App

After your app is deployed, making changes and updating the app is simple: All that is required is that you update the code on the GitHub repository and Netlify will automatically publish a new version of your application. In order to update your remote repository after you made changes to your code locally:

1. Stage updated files to the local repository: `git add .`
2. Commit these files: `git commit -m "Developed a new feature"`
3. Push the changes to your remote repository: `git push`

### Quick Note: Alternate Deployment Strategies (Seneca's "Matrix" Server)

As a final note, let's quickly discuss how we can deploy an Angular app to our "Matrix" accounts.

* First, run
  
  ```
ng build --base-href /~matrixuser/
  ```
  to get a production build (dist directory) (where matrixuser is your user name (ie: john.smith).
   
* Next, ftp to matrix and remove all the files from your public_html folder
  
* On your local machine create a .htaccess file with the contents:
  
  ```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^(.*) /~matrixuser/index.html [NC,L]
  ```
  
  (where matrixuser is your user name (ie: john.smith)

* Once this is complete, upload the .htaccess file to your public_html folder

* Finally, upload the contents of your "dist/my-app" folder (assuming your app is in the folder "my-app"  - basically you want to upload the contents of the folder containing index.html to the public_html folder on Matrix

* Now that your app is on Matrix, you should be able to access it using the path: 'https://matrix.senecacollege.ca/~matrixuser' (where matrixuser is your user name)
